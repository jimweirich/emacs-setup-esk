# Jim Weirich's Emacs Setup

This is my emacs setup.  It is currently based on the Emacs Starter
Kit, by Technomancy, version 1 (n.b. version 1 is the master branch, not v2). (https://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit/tree/master)

## Emacs Version

I'm using Emacs 23.3 from here: http://emacsformacosx.com/

(The Carbon Emacs package from
http://homepage.mac.com/zenitani/emacs-e.html is a bit older and the
starter kit is not compatibile with it, or so I've been told)

## Installing

(in progress)

* Install the Emacs Starter Kit listed above
* Clone this repository to .emacs.d/XXX (where XXX is your user name)

## Features

TBD
